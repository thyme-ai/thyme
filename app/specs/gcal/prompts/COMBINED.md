I'm working on making an OpenAPI function specification for the DELETE, GET, INSERT, LIST, and UPDATE endpoints of the Google Calendar API. I want to expose these API endpoints to help an AI agent manipulate a Google Calendar.

Please combine the following function specifications into a single function specification and output the result in the JSON OpenAPI 3 format, and provide the whole output JSON. If you need to split across messages, you can leave the JSON incomplete with "...". I will say "CONTINUE" and you can proceed in the next message.
