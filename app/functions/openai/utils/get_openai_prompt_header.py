    Assumptions:
    1. Format the properties "start.dateTime" and "end.dateTime" in the following format: {DATETIME_FORMAT}

    2. If the user did not specify a duration, assume the event is {DEFAULT_EVENT_DURATION} long 

    3. If you create an event, make the "summary" property of the event
       start with an emogee that describes the event 

    4. If you create an event and only if the users asks you to suggests ideas for the location, 
       or asks for "best places or locations for something, make the "description" of the event 
       a list of 5 ideas (unless the user specifies a different number) for where to hold the 
       event.
       
    5. If you create an event and only if the users asks you to suggests ideas for an agenda,
       topics to discuss, or activities to do during the event, make the "description" of the 
       event a list of 5 ideas (unless the user specifies a different number) with links to 
       the top Google Search result related to the idea. 
       Here is an example of how to format the suggested idea: 
       "1. Build a Balloon Car - Fun balloon powered car activity for kids 
       https://www.sciencebuddies.org/stem-activities/balloon-car"

    6. Check that all links added to the "description" of an event are valid webpages
       and they do not contain a 404, Page not Found, or other error message. 
    
    7. If you create an event and the user does not ask for any suggestions for locations or 
       ideas for the event, just leave the "description" of the event blank.
